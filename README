# Use this repository for non-thesis related R code. Scripts from training modules, classes, or side projects should
# added to this repository and then you can fork the repository in Rstudio to ensure you are working on the most
# current version of your code and you shouldn't have to re-define the workspace when editing on different devices
# (so long as you have an internet connection)
